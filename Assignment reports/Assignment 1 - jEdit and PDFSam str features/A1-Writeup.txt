CS515 Assignment 1

GOALS:
get familiar with two open-source software projects
jEdit, a free and open-source mature text editor; 
and PDFsam, a free and open-source application to manage PDF files

Use the systems
go through the source code
gain knowledge on the features they provide
their internal and external design
their coding style

i. To introduce students to active, medium-sized, open-source software systems;
ii. To provide students with the opportunity to become familiar with software systems that will be used in
upcoming assignments; and
iii. To introduce students to change request writing

download their sources, deploy them locally, 
 and navigate the code to get an insight on their design,
 main modules,
 dependencies, 
 test suites and technologies, 
 code style, etc.

Deliverables:
The deliverable of this assignment is a report that for each software system describes:
1. Its overall internal design. You could, for example, provide an overview of the purpose of projects and
packages composing the system.
2. At least one bug (i.e., unexpected behavior) that you experienced while using the application. Provide as
many details as possible. At the minimum, you should include: observed behavior, expected behavior and
steps to reproduce. Stack traces (if they exist) and screenshots are recommended.
3. At least two new features that you would like to see implemented in the application. Once again, provide as
many details as possible. Include adapted screenshots if they make your feature request clearer

What we did:
check their websites and search for documents related to features and usage
executed as many features as possible to find bugs, not all just enough
download their sources, deploy them locally, 
and navigate the code to get an insight on their design,
listed their packages with a short summary of what each package does
